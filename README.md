# RhinoDek-Classes
This shows multiple classes used inside of RhinoDek, a plugin for the Rhinocreos 5 CAD Software

# AutoIT
AutoIT is a bot program. I use the AutoIT.dll in VB.NET. You can simulate keystrokes and mouse clicks on window controls. This is needed to switch between Portrait and Landscape in Rhino5, as this is not an option in the Rhino API or Rhinoscript.
AutoIT is easy to use and the API is fully documented.

# Print Manager
The print manager is a massive undeeded class. Until Rhino5 is updated to use portrait and landscape in their API, a 900(and growing) class file is needed.

# SmartSheet Integration
I show how I integrated SmartSheets into the RhinoDek plugin
