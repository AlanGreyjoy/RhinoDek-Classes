How I did printing in RhinoDek

# Usage
You can use this as a guide. Printing in Rhinoceros 5 is tough. There are not alot of options. They also do not plan to fix any printing bugs in Rhino5, but plan to fix them in Rhino6. So this leaves me with a class file that's over 900 lines long. If they fixed just a few things (like portrait and landscape) the class file would be 100-200 lines long.

# AutoIT
AutoIT is a bot program. I use the AutoIT.dll in VB.NET. You can simulate keystrokes and mouse clicks on window controls. This is needed to switch between Portrait and Landscape in Rhino5, as this is not an option in the Rhino API or Rhinoscript.
AutoIT is easy to use and the API is fully documented.
